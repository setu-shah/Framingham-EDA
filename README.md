# Exploratory Data Analysis on Framingham Heart Study

When it launched in 1948, the original goal of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) was to identify common factors or characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular disease. Over the years, the FHS has become a successful, multigenerational study that analyzes family patterns of cardiovascular and other diseases, while gathering more genetic information from the two generations that followed the original study participants. The FHS also has expanded to include diverse populations so that risk factors in these different groups can be understood.
